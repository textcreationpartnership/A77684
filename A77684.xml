         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Hold my ſelfe bound to give your Excellency an account of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies late attempt upon this garriſon. A great party of horſe and foot from all their garriſons (with the aſsiſtance of VVallingford forces) under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Pr. <hi>Rupert</hi> fell upon us this morning early on Culham ſide, with intent to ſtorme us. They gained a bridge (where I kept a Centry) about halfe a mile from us, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet the Countrey to cut it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125225:3"/> down, to prevent our purſuit of them in caſe they ſhould be forced backe, making uſe of plankes for their own retreat upon the alarm; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the cutting down of the bridge, (which I had notice of) I drew forth to fight with them, firſt ſending out Scouts on the other ſide of the Town, and ſecuring our workes,) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the caſeway was long and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I was forced to ſend ſome of my men into the meades, who chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marched through the water, and ſo flanked the enemy on both ſides. The enemy fought it ſtoutly, and plied us with their Ordnance, which they brought along with them, and found (<hi>I</hi> bleſſe God) no leſſe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in ours, as the iſſue proved. The diſpute laſted almoſt foure houres; at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125225:3"/> length we gained the bridge ere they had quite broke it down, and forced them to the hedges and bankes adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, which proved of ſingular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them; but thoſe places proved too hot for them, and they allowed us to beate them out of the field, notwithſtanding the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we fought upon. Had it been propper or ſecure, in reſpect of the garriſon, we had followed them; but they haſted away with three Carts laden with dead men, beſides many thrown into the River, and others carried on their horſe backes. Their deſigne (I now underſtand) was, if they could not ſtorme us, then (by pulling up the bridge) to prevent our hindring them to fortifie the Lady <hi>Careys</hi> houſe and the Church in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125225:4"/> Culham, which would have proved of evill conſequence to us; but they were prevented.</p>
            <p>VVe loſt of note, onely Major <hi>Bradbury,</hi> a very gallant man, who was ſlaine upon the bridge, and ſeven or eight common Souldiers, at moſt; and had ſome wounded: Captaine <hi>Melvin</hi> and Captaine <hi>Butterfield</hi> are wounded, but without danger, of whom I muſt ſay, and of your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies Foot (whom <hi>I</hi> kept for our reſerve) they behaved themſelves with ſingular courage.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> was alſo in perſon here, with Sir <hi>Henry Gage</hi> Governor, and moſt of the Gentry of Oxford, to ſee the event. Sir <hi>Henry Gage</hi> was here ſlaine, and many others of note whom <hi>I</hi> know not yet.</p>

            <p>At the ſame preciſe time in the morning the enemies Horſe from Farringdon fell on our Horſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they found our men in more ready poſture then they expected: the alarm was preſently taken at all the quarters, being very neere toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and they came together, beate the enemy out of the Towne, chaſed them within a mile of Farringdon, and in purſuit ſlew, wounded, and tooke priſoners almoſt all, without any loſſe at all. Major <hi>Farmor,</hi> Major to Prince <hi>Charles</hi> regiment was ſlain, and his Lieutenant, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
